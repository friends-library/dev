## App Privacy Policy

The Friends Library app (iOS and Android) neither collects nor transmits any personally
identifiable data (PID). There is no tracking or telemetry of any kind. The Friends
Library app does not display any advertisements, and shares no data of any kind with any
third-party service.

All app user preferences (such as audio quality settings) are stored locally only on the
user's device, and are never transmitted or shared with Friends Library, any advertisers,
or any third party whatsoever.

The Friends Library is (and always will be) free of charge, and Friends Library is a
not-for-profit organization that has no need for or desire to earn any money. Therefore we
are always committed to the highest degree of user privacy, and have no incentives
whatsoever to track or monetize or share any data, nor do we at this time collect any data
at all about our users usage of the app.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us at through
