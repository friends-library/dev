  <strong>April 5, 2021</strong>&mdash;Friends Library now supports a new, plain-text
  download format specially designed for <em>text-to-speech apps</em>.
</Lead>

While [a growing number](/audiobooks) of our books are available in audiobook format, we
still have many titles not yet recorded, and it’s likely that some of our books never will
be. At the same time, apps designed to _read aloud from text sources_ continue to make
great improvements in quality and affordability. This new download format is specifically
designed to work well in these apps by stripping out all formatting, and making small
modifications like announcing the beginning and end of footnotes, which are read as
encountered.

To try out the new format, click the “Download” button below any of our books, and choose
the **Plain Text** format. It is recommended you initiate the download on the phone or
device with the text-to-speech app. At that point, you may have to “share” the file with
your app, using your phone or device's built-in features.

If you’re interested in trying out a text-to-speech app, we recommend
[Voice Dream Reader](https://www.voicedream.com/reader/).
