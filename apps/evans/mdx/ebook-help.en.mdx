  Because we want you to be able to read comfortably on any computer or digital device,
  all of our books can be downloaded for free in PDF or EPUB (electronic book) format, or
  accessed in the Friends Library app. This page will explain the basics of these digital
  formats, and answer questions for those who are inexperienced with reading books on a
  screen.

## Friends Library App

Probably the easiest way to read all of our books in digital format is in the built-in
e-reader found in our Android and iOS apps for your phone or tablet.

## eBooks and PDFs

If you can’t or don’t want to read our books from within our app, you can choose to read
digitally as a PDF or an eBook (EPUB). For most users, we recommend eBooks.

PDFs are basically just electronic images or static pictures of text. While these are
ideal for _printing documents to be read on paper,_ they are less than ideal for reading
books on a digital device. Advantages of eBooks over PDFs include:

- fonts on eBooks are resizable for more comfortable reading
- background and colors can be adjusted on eBooks to one&rsquo;s personal preference
- eBook reader apps automatically bookmark your last position
- with eBooks, you can easily jump to and from footnotes with a click
- eBooks are legible on all device sizes, including phones with very small screens

## What App Should I Use?

Almost any free eBook reader app should handle our books without a problem. Here are some
platform-specific recommendations:

### Android Device

- Amazon Kindle app
- Aldiko Book Reader

### Apple Device (Mac, iPhone, iPad)

- Apple “Books” app (recommended)
- Amazon Kindle app

### Windows PC / Device

- Amazon Kindle app
- Kobo app
- Nook app
