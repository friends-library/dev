  We currently have %NUM_AUDIOBOOKS% of our titles recorded as{' '}
  <a href="./audiobooks">audiobooks</a>, and that number will continue to grow. But
  downloading and listening to an audiobook can be confusing if you&rsquo;ve never done it
  before. This page will explain our available formats and answer the most common
  questions about using Friends Library audiobooks.

## Recommendation: Get the App

If you have an Android or iOS device (like an iPhone or iPad), we recommend you download
**our free app.** It allows you to listen to any of our audiobooks, and is automatically
updated whenever we release a new one. It also handles downloading the audio files for
offline use, and always remembers where you were listening last so you can pick up right
where you left off.

For more information and to download the app, [click here.](/app)

## Text-to-Speech Apps

For any of our books that **do not yet have an audiobook,** we do offer a plain-text
download format specifically designed for use with a _text-to-speech_ app, like “Voice
Dream.” For more details, [see here](/plain-text-format).

## Other Audio Formats

If you'd like to listen to any of our audiobooks outside the app, you have several
choices:

- **Stream** the audio from your web browser
- Listen as a **Podcast**
- Download as an `.mp4` (audiobook)
- Download in `.mp3` format

All of these options are shown on the dedicated page for every title
[available as an audiobook](/audiobooks).

## Podcast help

To listen to one of our audiobooks as a podcast, start by trying to _click on a podcast
link_ from the page on our site containing an audiobook, like
[this page](/william-penn/no-cross-no-crown#audiobook). In many cases, your phone or
device will already have a podcast-capable app installed, and it will send you straight to
the correct app. For instance, on iOS devices (like iPhone and iPad), clicking one of our
podcast links should immediately open up the built-in _iOS Podcasts App_.

If clicking one of our podcast links _doesn’t work the first time,_ you might need to
download a podcast app. Search your device&rsquo;s app store for &ldquo;Podcasts&rdquo;
and choose one that is both widely used and free. Once installed, try our podcast link
again. If the link still doesn’t work, try copying the URL of the podcast link from your
browser and pasting it directly it into your podcast app. Most podcast apps have a feature
to manually enter a feed URL, for example in Apple Podcasts, the option is called “Follow
a Show by URL.”

### Common (and free) podcast apps

- Apple Podcasts
- Google Podcasts
- Overcast
- RadioPublic
- CastBox
- Stitcher

## M4B

Our audiobooks are also available in the **M4B** format, which is a widely used audio file
type specifically intended for audiobooks. If you have a program that allows you to listen
to M4B files, you might want to download our books in this format. The Apple _iTunes_ app
is capable of playing M4B files, and you can also play them on an iOS device (iPhone or
iPad) using the Apple _Books_ app. There are likely many other apps that can play this
format as well.

## MP3

**MP3** is a very common audio file type that is compatible with just about any music or
audio app. If you would like MP3s of our audiobooks, we provide the option to download all
of the chapters as MP3 files, zipped up in one folder for simplicity. But please note:
when listening to an MP3, most apps will not automatically remember your place. For this
reason, downloading as a podcast or using the M4B format is recommended when possible.
